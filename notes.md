content:
- when you might need metaprogramming?
    + show some real-world repetitive C++ code
    + Show stuff that people write in Python
    + Show what we would like to "express" in C++
    + After a couple examples, explain why it's difficult in C++ (lack of tools)

- examples:
    + network message (see Fusion presentation)
    + signal combiner (see Fusion presentation)
    + euclidean distance (n-dimensional)
    + dimensional analysis (see MPL book p.39)


    + sorting computations (cgr-style)



sequences I'd like to cover:
- tuple
- map
- optional?
- types + type traits
- compile-time strings

algorithms I'd like to cover:
- for_each
- filter/remove_if
- find_if/find
